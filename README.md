### DESCRIPTION

<p style="font-height:12px">
    This is a calculator project that counts with the four basic operations, but it also counts with a 'allClear' button and also a backspace button to give users the possibility to clean all the operations or just to erase some input error.
</p>
<p style="font-height:12px">
    Some other buttons like 'equals' and 'dot' buttons also are presented in this calculator.

    <strong>WHAT WAS THE HARDEST THING TO DO?</strong></br> I had no idea how hard could be programming numbers more than one decimal place. I needed some help from the internet community to make this.
</p> 
<p style="font-height:12px">
    To be honest, this project was really challenging. I was used to programming calc projects only in the backend and using 'console.log', but this was the first project I brought all this code to life through the front end.
